### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts. Case study 2 with Comparative Analysis Prompt, Universal Prompt, Structures Prompt Refinements and Prompt Size Limitations


# Experimental Scenarios :


# Scenario 1 – Smart Sensors in Urban Water Pipelines


Objective: Detect early signs of leakage, reduce water wastage, and lower maintenance costs.

Method: Sensors capture flow rates, pressure, and acoustic signals → AI detects anomalies.

Expected Benefit: Preventive alerts, reduced infrastructure losses, sustainability.


# Scenario 2 – Self-Driving Cars at Crowded Intersections


Objective: Maximize passenger and pedestrian safety by making ethical, real-time decisions.

Method: Cars use cameras, LiDAR, radar + AI algorithms → analyze movement of vehicles/pedestrians → decide on yielding, braking, or rerouting.

Expected Benefit: Reduced accidents, improved traffic flow, enhanced public trust.


# Prompts Using Diverse Techniques :


1. Comparative Analysis Prompt

"Compare how AI-enabled smart sensors for pipeline leakage prevention and self-driving cars in crowded intersections address safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Highlight which system demonstrates higher reliability under real-world constraints."


2. Comparative Analysis Prompt with Size Limitations

"In 80 words or less, compare the effectiveness of AI-based smart sensors in water pipelines and AI in self-driving cars at intersections. Focus only on real-time decision-making and risk prevention."

# Conclusion :


Smart sensors excel in reliability and sustainability, making them suitable for infrastructure protection.

Self-driving cars face higher decision complexity but are crucial for public safety in mobility.

Prompt size limitations force the focus onto core features (real-time decision-making & risk prevention), removing descriptive detail but highlighting essentials.

 This shows how comparative analysis prompting and prompt size limitations shape the scope and depth of AI-driven research reports.
